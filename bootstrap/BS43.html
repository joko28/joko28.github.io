<h1 style="font-family:courier;" class="text-info">MEME MASHUP</h1>
  <p style="font-family:courier;" class="text-white">Before taking this class, I did go online, social media, to look at memes. I had no interest for memes, and just went on with my everyday life, going to school, work, and hang out with my friends.</p>
  <p style="font-family:courier;" class="text-white">But after doing this meme mashup assignment, I got more interested in what was going on in social media, everyone talks about memes and find them educational. They are now fun and enjoyable to go through.</p>
  
<h2 style="font-family:courier;" class="text-info">Individual Meme Mashup</h2>
	<p style="font-family:courier;" class="text-white">Original Meme Photos</p>

	<p style="font-family:courier;" class="text-white">This meme is a complication I made thinking about how babysitters feel when they are with children they can’t handle. I thought about this, because I remembered a time my grandma would babysit me and I was one of the most annoying children she took care of and she would yell at me, but wouldn’t do anything about it since I was still only a child. I related this concept to cartoons, such as the Incredibles Jack-Jack, the baby, to make it more funny and aligned with the story..</p>

	<p style="font-family:courier;" class="text-white">This is a group meme partnership we did, the image on the right is my mashup. For this assignment, each group member had to pick out a meme they had found online, share it with one other member and mash them together to create our own unique meme from two other memes we found.</p>

	<p style="font-family:courier;" class="text-white">This is my armor-car meme draft. This photoshop assignment was an intro to photoshop, so we used this armor puppet to photoshop onto this image of a street with cars and buildings.</p>
